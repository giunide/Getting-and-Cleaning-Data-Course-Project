#Transformations
The zip file containing the source data is located at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The following transformations were applied to the source data:

- The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
- The measurements on the mean and standard deviation (i.e. signals containing the strings mean and std) were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.
- The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names (see Identifiers section).
- The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X was expanded to timeDomainBodyAccelerometerMeanX), using the following set of rules:
- The initial f and t were expanded to frequencyDomain and timeDomain respectively.
- Acc, Gyro, Mag, Freq, mean, and std were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, Frequency, Mean, and StandardDeviation respectively.
- Special characters (i.e. (, ), and -) were removed
- From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
